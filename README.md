# Bangkit Capstone Project 2021

Lung Detector - B21-CAP0053
Theme : Healtcare


# Introduction
In this capstone project our team created COVID-19 detection based on rontgen thorax (X ray) scan of lungs. Using android based apps, with help of machine learning for classification will be built until its achieved best accuracy (98%) for the machine learning model (http://sinta.ristekbrin.go.id/covid/penelitian/detail/106). 
Raw X ray lung data gained from a dataset that was manually labeled by the professionals (radiologist), dividing into 3 classes, normal lungs, covid-19 lungs, and pneumonia lungs.  All the data will be segmented into training data, validation data, and test data and will result in classification of a patient between identified as COVID-19 or normal. Results from the classification will be presented in android apps so that the user will be able to see the result in the pleasing UI.
